phIndex
=======

Simply copy index.php into the directory you want to index. Change excludes and formatting as needed. The script will take care
of replicating itself in the sub-directory tree.

If you ever want to update the script, simply update the one that's at the root of your index hierarchy. The script will
compare timestamps of index.php files in sub-directories and replace them if needed.
